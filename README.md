For my disertation/thesis work, I created a course timetable scheduling console application using Java. This app helps generate the most suitable timetable for a typical University Student. The concept of Genetic Algorithm was applied when creating the console application, and after "x" generations, the application will identify the best "most fit" timetable which university students can use in their day to day lives.
